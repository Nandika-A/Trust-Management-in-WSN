Trust management in IoT is crucial for fostering collaboration, mitigating risks, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data. Trust plays a critical role in ensuring the reliability, security, and efficiency of IoT systems, particularly in the context of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), where resource constraints and dynamic environments pose unique challenges. 
In WSNs, where nodes operate in dynamic and often hostile environments, trust mechanisms are essential for detecting anomalies, preventing malicious attacks, and maintaining system resilience. This mechanism delves into the realm of trust management in IoT, exploring the intricacies of trust establishment, evaluation, and maintenance within WSNs. By leveraging trust models, IoT systems can achieve robustness, scalability, and adaptability without compromising on performance or resource utilization.
